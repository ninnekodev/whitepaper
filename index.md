Ninneko is set in a deep forest, where villages are mysterious and defensible. Alpha Ninneko, those first villagers who create the history and maintain the culture of the village. They have lived and protected the village for their generations. As more and more Beta Ninneko comes to life, the land becomes increasingly scarce. As a result, the villagers begin invading one another, resulting in the ultimate war. Wild Ninneko was born with the mission to be the leader, to preserve the village history, thanks to their extraordinary senses and abilities.

Their goal is to conquer the whole forest, build new villages, and establish a strong empire. To carry out the invasion, the village creates potential teams and continuously trains. A strategic Ninneko team is a combination of 5 classes: warrior, support, mage, ranger, assassin. Will Ninneko village be strong enough to defeat others? Will the empire be thriving or struggling?

Ninneko plays an integral part in the in-game battle, each Ninneko has different stats: heal, attack, armor, speed, and its hand determines its class: Warrior, Mage, Support, Ranger, Assassin. 

Each Ninneko can be bred a maximum of 6 times. Breeding Ninneko costs some NINO and MATA, depending on how many times the Ninneko have been bred.

Alpha Ninneko is the first generation, it costs only NINO tokens to breed. Beta Ninneko is the second generation. You can randomly select two Ninneko to pair up with. 
<!-- When a baby Ninneko doesn’t possess traits that can be seen in either of its parents, it’s called a mutation. Mutated Ninneko might have a new WILD gene. If you are lucky, breeding may result in these super rare genes. A wild Ninneko has x2 bonus stats. -->
