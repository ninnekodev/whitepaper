# Genes
---

For each cattribute, a Ninneko possesses 3 genes. The primary gene (P), is the visible trait, the remaining two genes (H1, H2) are the Ninneko’s hidden traits.

Genes are either primary or hidden based on their location in the Ninneko’s genome sequence. 

Primary gene has a higher chance of getting passed on to a Ninneko's offspring while hidden gene has a lower chance. 

The primary genes determine the cat’s appearance. The hidden traits aren’t visible in Ninneko’s appearance but may get inherited by the offspring.

### Breeding

You can randomly select two Ninneko to pair up with. Remember to understand the breeding mechanics before breeding a specific Ninneko.

!!! 
Ninnekos don't lay eggs

The probabilities in genetics:


|Gene|% to pass|
|---|---|
|P|36%|
|H1|10%|
|H2|4%|

By breaking down a Ninneko’s genetic code, it’s possible to predict the probabilities when breeding 2 Ninneko.

Unlike normal gene, [!badge variant="info" text="WILD" corners="pill" ]&nbsp; gene has very low chance of getting passed to the offspring

<!-- ### Mutation

When a baby Ninneko doesn’t possess traits that can be seen in either its parents’, it’s called a mutation. Mutated Ninneko might have a new [!badge variant="info" text="WILD" corners="pill" ]&nbsp; gene

### Breeding fee

Each Ninneko can be bred a maximum of 6 times. Breeding a Ninneko costs some NINO and MATA, depending on how many times the Ninneko have been bred.

|Breed|MATA|
|---|---|
|1|3600|
|2|5500|
|3|9400|
|4|15000|
|5|24000|
|6|38000|

!!! 
First generation - [!badge variant="info" text="alpha" corners="pill" ]&nbsp;Ninneko can be bred with 0 MATA (but it still costs NINO)
